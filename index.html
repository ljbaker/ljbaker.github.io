		I'm a cognitive science researcher working for the Cognitive Data Science (CODAS) Lab at Rutgers University - Newark. My research broadly covers computational analysis of human cognition with a particular focus on digital media. I've done work predicting the items in movies people are most likely to notice, the elements of a story people are most likely to remember and I've attempted to find the perceptually ideal location to joint two film edits. More recently I'm applying  machine learning to educational settings to identify moments when kids are primed for learning to help teachers and researchers better connect with their students. For fun I like to figure out how movies engross audiences on both a perceptual and social level.
