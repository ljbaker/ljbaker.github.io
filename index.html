		I'm a data scientist working at <a href="https://www.pymetrics.com/">pymetrics</a>, with a background in cognition and cognitive neuroscience. My research broadly covers computational analysis of individual differences within human cognition, with a particular focus on digital media. I've done work predicting the items in movies people are most likely to notice, the elements of a story people are most likely to remember, and the perceptually ideal location to join two film edits. Over the past few years my research has turned to computational modeling, where I've identified which students engaged with a task using computer vision, predicted feelings of presence and emotional engagement in virtual reality, and most recently modeled worker performance based on their psychological profile. For fun I like to figure out how movies and video games engross audiences on both a perceptual and social level. You can check out more detailed descriptions of my current projects <a href = "./projects">here</a>.</p>
