# Public Repository of Cognitive Science Projects

Hey! I'm a cognitive science researcher working for the Cognitive Data Science (CODAS) Lab at Rutgers University - Newark. Our research general covers computational analysis of human behavior, including probabilistic models of  the early visual system, artificially intelligent teaching agents for educational applications, modeling of learning curves in early childhood and application of computer vision towards understanding group dynamics.

My work looks at three aspects of human behavior:

### Attention, Memory and Awareness

Years of research in biology, psychology and neuroscience have demonstrated the limited scope of vision. The large majority of visual processing occurs in the fovea, a concentrated patch of cones near the center of the retina that covers roughly the size of a thumbnail at arm's distance. It is a wonder that we notice anything in our periphery at all, and yet we experience much of the world as a continuous stream of information. The visual system achieves these feats using *visual attention* to track informative properties and *working memory* to briefly store items of potential impact to the near future. Many of my experiments in graduate school investigated the cognitive underpinnings of situational awareness, often demonstrating flagrant inabilities to notice moving vehicles, parts of conversation, or even items held in one's own hands.

Recently, I've become interested in the low-level visual properties that direct attention seemingly automatically. To this end, we are using virtual reality training to increase awareness of specific types of visual stimuli. The end goal will be to improve people's perceptual awareness while they go about their day. Imagine: training your brain to detect birds like a professional birdwatcher while you do nothing more than watching TV. That's the goal, anyway.
