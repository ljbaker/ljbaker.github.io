project being conducted by a research team at Rutgers University, under the
direction of Dr. Elizabeth Bonawitz and Dr. Vanessa
LoBue. We are interested in how people are able to learn so much about the
different objects they encounter in the world around them. We are currently
studying individuals learning and development in multiple domains, including
emotional, cognitive, and conceptual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

60 minutes. In most cases, we will only ask to see you for one, but possibly
several brief sessions. During the session, you will be presented with objects
or images, you may watch a video clip, perform a computer task, read brief
paragraphs, look at pictures, and/or answer a series of questionnaires. </span><span

providing explanations), learn from and teach others, observe events as well as
perform actions such as moving or reaching toward certain objects, grouping
objects, or activating toys. </span><span style='font-family:"Arial Narrow"'>There
are no &quot;right or wrong responses to any of these questions or tasks we
simply want to find out how people approach objects and situations. Please note
