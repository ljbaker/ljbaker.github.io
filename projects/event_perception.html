<h1>Event Perception</h1>
<p>With a glance you can understand so much of the world around you. The brain recognizes collections of features (e.g., <i>red</i>, <i>smooth</i>, <i>shiny</i>) as objects (<i>an apple</i>). The brain also automatically encodes collections of objects in space (e.g., <i>lawn chairs</i>, <i>sand</i>, <i>plastic buckets</i>, <i>sunshine</i>) as a single scene (<i>a beach</i>). Likewise, the brain encodes whole moments of time (e.g., <i>pouring coffee</i>, <i>grabbing sugar</i>, <i>pouring sugar</i>, <i>grabbing milk</i>, <i>pouring milk</i>, <i>stirring</i>) as a single event (<i>making coffee</i>). I spent a lot of time trying to understand how we understand events.</p>

<p>Research in event perception has extremely useful scientific and real-world applications. Within basic science, understanding how the brain processes events reveals a great deal about how systems of attention, memory and decision-making leverage our limited mental capacities to focus on important items while ignoring the banal. In application, understanding how the brain parses events can lead to innovations in condensing information. Think about it: automatic video encoding that extracts only the moments most important for understanding the event, or software that leverages how human beings anticipate events to predict short-term human behavior. All these things are very possible within our lifetime.</p>
