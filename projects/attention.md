title: "Attention, Memory and Awareness"
---

Years of research in biology, psychology and neuroscience have demonstrated the limited scope of vision. The majority of visual processing occurs in the fovea, a concentrated patch of light receptors near the center of the retina that covers roughly the size of a thumbnail at arm's distance. If the visual system is so limited, why does the world around us seem complete? The visual system achieves these feats using *visual attention* to track informative properties and *short term memory* to briefly store items of potential impact to the near future. Many of my experiments investigate situational awareness, often demonstrating flagrant inabilities to notice moving vehicles, parts of conversation, or even items held in one's own hands.

Recently, I've become interested in the low-level visual properties that direct attention seemingly automatically. To this end, we are using virtual reality training to increase awareness of specific types of visual stimuli. The end goal will be to improve people's perceptual awareness while they go about their day. Imagine: training your brain to detect birds like a professional birdwatcher while you do nothing more than watching TV. That's the goal, anyway.
