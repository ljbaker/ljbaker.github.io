title: Data Science &amp; Statistical Analysis

<h1>Data Science &amp; Statistical Analysis</h1>
<p>I really enjoy digging through data. I have a doctoral certificate in quantitative methods and postdoctoral training in machine learning, which I use to find nuanced trends in human behavior using massive collections of data. I will occasionally post <a href="https://github.com/ljbaker/ljbaker.github.io/tree/master/CogSci17">data analysis from completed projects</a> and welcome feedback on more efficient or interesting methods.</p>
