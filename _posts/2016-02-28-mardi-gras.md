Hey internet. Since I'm missing Mardi Gras for the first time in 11 years, I've decided to invest all my energies into getting my work out in the world.

Credit goes where credit is due: The first pass of this website borrows heavily from [a tutorial by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 

Please be gentle.

Sincerely,

Lewis
